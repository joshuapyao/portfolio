                <h2 id="contributions">MY CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
                <p>I worked on this project independently in a two-week sprint. I conducted research, ideation, design, and testing.</p>
              <hr class="featurette-divider">

            <h1 data-toc-text="Introduction" id="introduction"></h1>
              <p>Vent is a lifestyle improvement app that helps users find nearby events. <span class="highlight">With this app, people can become “in the know” and discover all that’s happening around their city.</span> Students can know about upcoming career fairs. Music lovers can find out about artists touring nearby. Foodies can plan for food events. The avenues that open are endless.</p>

             <p>This design was a rapid one-week project. To create this design, my flow could be reduced down to three major steps:</p>
              <ol>
              		<li>Establishing the Goal</li>
					<li>Understand the User</li>
					<li>Designing for the User</li>
				</ol>
				<hr class="featurette-divider">
				<div class="headliner">
					<h1 id="establishing">ESTABLISHING THE GOAL</h1>
	            	<p class="subtitle">“Setting the requirements of success”</p>
	        	</div>
	        	<hr class="featurette-divider">
	        	<p>The design cycle first began with <span class="highlight">establishing the goals and the requirements for success.</span> These were to establish the baseline of the design, and to ensure that I kept the primary focus and business intentions in mind.</p>

				<p>The concept for Vent originated from my personal experience. I often was finding out about events, including career fairs, the day it happened. This led to me often unprepared or unable to attend at all. <span class="highlight">With no centralized resource for events, it was hard to keep track of all those events.</span></p>

	        	<p>This is where Vent can improve one’s lifestyle, which was also the main goal. By having an application that allows people to easily find, explore, and parse through the countless events happening around them daily, <span class="highlight">users can ensure that they don’t miss out on those events, while also helping them discover something new.</span></p>

				<p>We also conducted <span class="highlight">competitive analysis</span>, looking particularly in three similar products that supported checking the IV pumps away from the location. We were able to procure some design implications but ultimately found that <span class="highlight">there were no products serving the same purpose as the interface we were designing.</span></p>

				<div class="headliner">
					<h1 id="understanding">UNDERSTANDING THE USER</h1>
	            	<p class="subtitle">“Knowing who to build for”</p>
	        	</div>

				<p>After establishing the baseline of the design, I would have to <span class="highlight">understand the user.</span> This was slightly more difficult in the beginning, since events are not more exclusive to one demographic. Thus, I shifted and focused on users that would most likely use an app or technology to explore events. This led me to the user base of Yelp, since that application has an established user base which uses the app to rate and discover new restaurants. <span class="highlight">My primary user would likely mirror that.</span></p>

				<p>With my primary user in hand, I could <span class="highlight">establish a persona of the user through primary and secondary research.</span> I conducted a few interviews with my primary user to understand how they searched for events, tracked them, and how they decided which events to attend.</p>

				<p>From then on, I was able to build a <span class="highlight">list of needs and requirements</span> that the app should meet. Using this to inform my design, I developed the <span class="highlight">information architecture</span> of the application, and then <span class="highlight">sketched some mockups.</span></p>

					<h1 id="designing">DESIGNING FOR THE USER</h1>
	            	<p class="subtitle">“Building a user-centered design”</p>
	        	</div>
            	<hr class="featurette-divider">

				<p>After designing the flow of the app, as well as a basic look and feel, I created a <span class="highlight">paper prototype</span> to help with initial testing. This helped me gain some insight on how my design could be further improved. In evaluation, <span class="highlight">I focused on how fast people were able to reach their goal,</span> such as finding a nearby event that they’re interested in. I also looked for how fast people were able to find the right option, how easily it was to interface, and how much users liked the look and flow of it.</p>

				<p>Finally, compiling what I learned from evaluation stages, I created a <span class="highlight">high-fidelity digital interactive prototype</span> for my final deliverable. I used Adobe Illustrator to create assets and Adobe XD to put it all together and add interactions to the prototype.</p>

				<p>After numerous design iterations, the end result was an interface that allowed the user to find nearby events and gave them options of how to use that information. Overall, the prototype served its purpose well and received positive impressions on the look and the overall flow of the design. Users said they found it easy and engaging to use. Through Vent, technology could help make people’s lives a little more eventful.</p>
