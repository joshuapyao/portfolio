          <h2 data-toc-skip>The Problem.</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">Cloud Engineers have to make enormously complex diagrams for numerous reasons, whether it’s communicating changes or for documentation purposes. Lucidchart had just a barebones feature for importing architectures, but it was rarely used because it was hard to import the data correctly and even harder to manipulate it. Often times, engineers would end up deleting the imported architecture and remake it from scratch. <span class="highlight"> Making a cloud architecture diagram is a pain and a nuisance no one looked forward to doing.</span></p>

			 <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-toc-skip>My Impact.</h2>
			<p data-aos="fade-up"><span class="highlight">For this project, I was the sole designer on a scrum team working within a 2-week sprint cycle.</span> My team consisted of myself, a product manager, five engineers, and a QA specialist. I was responsible for designing the experience around the import of Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud architectures into Lucidchart, ranging from how users import the architecture and how they can interact with the diagram on the canvas.</p>
			<p data-aos="fade-up">The early metrics set for this project was a set number of users who would adopt the integration. Through sales tests and post-release data, CloudInsights far surpassed the metrics set before it.</p>
			<p data-aos="fade-up">The output of the project was the first version of Lucidchart’s CloudInsights, which now has <span class="highlight">an additional three teams dedicated to its success.</span> It also led to two new components primarily focused for complex data-diagrams and was <span class="highlight">scaled into other integrations</span> such as Salesforce or bambooHR.</p>
		  
			<h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-toc-skip>My Plan.</h2>
			<p data-aos="fade-up">On starting this project, I took stock of what was already done and strategized my plan for designing this experience. Following the user flow for other integrations in the product, I split the design based on two factors to design for:</p>

			<p>Hitting the ground, I had no idea how an AWS architecture worked. I was pretty lost in this extremely complicated world. <span class="highlight">So here's a short crash course as how I understood it.</span></p>

        <p>To design for architecture diagrams, I had to first understand them. While conducting research, I also independently learned about AWS architectures and how they were structured.</p>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img src="images/lucid/example.png" alt="Example AWS Diagramming">
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>In short, clouds provide multiple services ranging from computing servers, deployment services, traffic distribution, and more. An entire system, from the moment a user enters a website and finally completes their goal, can exist on the cloud.</p>
					</div>
        </div>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>Cloud architectures are structured in a certain way, with some elements only allowed to live in some objects. For example, an EC2 must exist in a subnet, which exists in an availability zone, which is in a VPC, which is in a region. However, there are hundreds of different types of instances and each has their own special rules. <span class="highlight">Don’t worry, I hate it too.</span></p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">

					</div>
		</div>
		<div data-aos="fade-up" class="title-bar bg-match"></div>
		<h1 data-aos="fade-up">Research.</h1>
		<p>I first wanted to understand the problems with our primary users, hoping to understand the higher-level problems and motivations, while identifying key pain points in a DevOps personas job. Through this stage I conducted three types of research:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" class="no-shadow" src="images/lucid/research.png" alt="Initial Research Methods">
		<h2 id="clientinterview">Competitive Analysis.</h2>
		<p>First off, I looked into the market to examine whether existing products efficiently help users visualize their architecture.</p>
		<img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/competitors.png" alt="Competitors">
		<p>I found that:</p>
		<ul data-aos="fade-up">
			<li>Services like Cloudcraft and CloudViz offered a way to import and visualize multiple accounts, <span class="highlight">but didn't have a way to see everything all together.</span></li>
			<li>Some lacked some of Lucidchart's base functionality such as collaboration or preview modes.</li>
			<li>Some allow users to customize how each element is displayed, but <span class="highlight">no way to quickly switch between customized options.</span></li>
			<li><span class="highlight">Most services only offered the ability to make a diagram and export it as an image.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>With this information, I knew no other competitor had a holistic offering and also that our <span class="highlight">design should include the ability to import multiple accounts and customize views in order to surpass competitors.</span></p>
		
		<h2>Interviews & Affinity Diagramming.</h2>
		<p>Through out the process of competitive analysis, I also conducted interviews with real users along side my PM. THe goals were to identify their "jobs to be done", needs, and pain points.</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">With this I conducted affinity diagramming to summarize our research.</span></p>
		<img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/affinity.jpg" alt="Affinity Diagramming">
        <p>From this, some key problems surfaced:</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
			<div class="flex-inline">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Multiple Programs for Management.</strong></p>
					<p class="left-line">Users often end up using 3-4 programs to manage architecture. Some to document, manage costs, simulating changes, or to see the current status.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-inline">
				<div>
					<p><strong>"Hacky" Methods.</strong></p>
					<p class="left-line">For more customization, some users would paste different account views on top of each other to get it all on one screen.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-inline">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Long and Tedious.</strong></p>
					<p class="left-line">Cloud Architecture can be huge, extending to thousands of objects. Creating or manually correcting one can take hours.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-inline">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Repetitive.</strong></p>
					<p class="left-line">Every time a change is made to the architecture, a diagram must be updated and new documentation must be generated.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="flex-inline">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Wide Audience.</strong></p>
					<p class="left-line">As well as creating a full picture of the architecture, architects must also create views to communicate changes to both engineers and directors, each with different goals.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>There also was valuable information regarding user workflows, motivations, and more that was helpful in building out our personas and fueling our design thinking.</p>
        
        <h2>Personas.</h2>
        <p>From synthesizing the research I generated three personas, two who were primary users and one who was secondary. These personas were posted up at every table in the scrum team to ensure we were focused on our user.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p data-aos="fade-up"><strong>The Cloud Engineer</strong></p>
		<p data-aos="fade-up">Directly responsible for his company’s cloud, Jordan governs and makes changes to his cloud while communicating changes to other engineers and executives clearly and efficiently. He wants to keep errors low and everything clearly documented. <span class="highlight">Some jobs to be done (JTBD) include creating diagrams for presentations, analyzing the current infrastructure, and updating documentation.</span></p>
		<a href="images/lucid/persona-1.png" data-lightbox="process-3"><img data-aos="fade-up" class="shadow" src="images/lucid/persona-1.png" alt="Persona - Cloud Engineer"></a>
		<br/>
		<p data-aos="fade-up"><strong>The Solution Architect</strong></p>
		<p data-aos="fade-up">Yakshir works at a consulting firm for building and optimizing companies’ clouds. While exuding professionalism and quality, he wants to efficiently restructure a cloud with proper documentation so it can be handed off easily. <span class="highlight">Some JTBD include quickly understanding the architecture, drafting and visualizing changes, and ensuring that changes match specifications.</span></p>
		<a href="images/lucid/persona-2.png" data-lightbox="process-4"><img data-aos="fade-up" class="shadow" src="images/lucid/persona-2.png" alt="Persona - Solution Architect"></a>
		<br/>
		<p data-aos="fade-up"><strong>The IT Director</strong></p>
		<p data-aos="fade-up"><span class="highlight">Ryan doesn’t directly interact with the cloud,</span> but he knows the importance of it and what tools best help his company. He’s primarily responsible if his company picks up a new tool or not. If so, transitions need to be smooth and benefits need to far outweigh the costs.</p>
		<a href="images/lucid/persona-3.png" data-lightbox="process-5"><img data-aos="fade-up" class="shadow" src="images/lucid/persona-3.png" alt="Persona - IT Director"></a>
		<br/>
		<br/>

		<div data-aos="fade-up" class="title-bar bg-match"></div>
		<h1 data-aos="fade-up">Design.</h1>
		<h2>Brainstorming.</h2>
		<p>Building off the research I worked with my PM to imagine how we could <span class="highlight">re-engineer our user's approach entirely.</span></p>
        <p>I lead this conversation by focusing on the entire current user journey and looking deeper at other applications that our users used. My goal was to see how Lucidchart could become the single solution for their needs.</p>
		<p>This lead to our solution: <span class="highlight">an end-to-end flow where users could build, monitor, and present all from Lucidchart.</span></p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/before.png" alt="The Before Flow">
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/after.png" alt="The After Flow">
        <p>Based on the flow, I worked with my PM and came up with a number of high-level features or capabilities. To further understand these features, I went through this flow in treating out how these features would behave and act:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/feature-flow.png" alt="How Features Were Decided">
        <!--<p>Throughout this, regarding the features, I wanted to discover:</p>
        <ul>
					<li>What should it accomplish?</li>
					<li>When and why does the user use it?</li>
					<li>How should it treat the user?</li>
					<li>How does it scale across the product?</li>
		</ul>
        
        <p>From user feedback in interviews and past integrations, users had a number of requests:</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Line Control</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Drawing lines between instances is one of the most important parts for communicating architecture diagrams.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Spacing</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Tweaking spacing between instances as a whole make reduce lots of tedious movement.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Sorting and Grouping</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">How instances are sorted and grouped together is extremely important in identifying what’s most relevant.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Labels</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Removing labels from unnecessary object would reduce word clutter in presentations.</p>
						</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Overall Layout</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Quickly switching the overall layout would simplify presentations to both directors and engineers immensely.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Data Refresh</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Being able to refresh would make it useful to not need to constantly import a new architecture each time it was updated.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
		</div>
	-->
	<p>Using this model and working with the PM and the team tech lead to see what was feasible, I built out the core functionality of this integration:</p>

		</div>
	-->
		<h2>Prototype.</h2>
        <p>Using Lucid's design system, I implemented the features in a prototype, which my PM took on sales tests to see whether this cohesive experience appealed to users. <span class="highlight">Through these tests, CloudInsights was projected to surpass its adoption metrics.</span></p>
		<div class="video-wrapper">

		  </div>
		<p>With all the features designed out, the project was complete. <strong>Or so I thought.</strong></p>
		<p>In testing with actual users, problems arose, particularly around two areas: the import flow and the left panel.</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">Users found the import flow dense and difficult to understand,</span> with it lacking information and also producing diagrams they didn't expect, leading users to redo the flow again and again. The left panel also had issues, with <span class="highlight">users having difficulty finding tools and not even exploring the menus to see the options available to them.</span></p>
		<p><span class="highlight">To provide the best possible users experience, these components had to be redesigned, yet also work when extended across the product.</span></p>
		<br/>
		<br/>

		<div data-aos="fade-up" class="title-bar bg-match"></div>
		<h1 data-aos="fade-up">Challenge #1: The Import Flow.</h1>
		<h2>The Problem.</h2>
        <p>The current import flow allowed for users to import their account through three different methods, choose a few options, and get it on the canvas.</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/old-flow.png" alt="Old Import Modal Flow">
        <p>However, in order to offer a more robust experience, the new import flow would have to manage this:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/new-flow.png" alt="New Import Modal Flow">

        <p>The reason for this far more complex flow was due to user needs and also experience design decisions:</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Multiple Accounts</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Being able to import multiple accounts is essential, as many users often have a single cloud spanning across multiple AWS accounts, but need to be able to see everything on one screen.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Filtering Data</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Despite the security of our product, a small portion of our users would need to keep some data regarding their architecture removed from import. We wanted to meet the needs of these users and provide that ability, instead of forcing them to manually diagram their architecture due to requirements.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Page Layout</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">We found that if users weren’t happy with how things were automatically laid out, they often found it easier to restart from scratch rather than move everything around. By enabling more flexibility in the final layout, we could ensure a better user experience all-around.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Shapes</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">AWS comes out with new shapes to represent their instances rather frequently. Unfortunately, not all users like to represent their diagrams with newer shapes, some preferring the older skeuomorphic designs.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
        <p>With the pre-existing component and to maintain consistency across the product, this new flow had to exist in the current import modal.</p>
		
		<h2>Explorations.</h2>
		<p>I created multiple versions in the import modal, each with a different approach, and tested them with both users, my scrum team, and the UX team. Each one ran into problems.</p>

		</div>
		<p>From this exercise, it was clear the biggest issue was the multiple account import. There were problems in needing to:</p>
        <ul data-aos="fade-up">
          <li>Add multiple accounts.</li>
          <li>Offer enough supporting information.</li>
          <li>Sometimes filter data before import.</li>
          <li>Import from previously added accounts.</li>
          <li>Handle errors.</li>
          <li>Allow different import options.</li>
          <li>Be intuitive and easy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I also noticed a number of issues with the modal itself, primarily in the small size not providing an immersive experience, no progress trackers, poor navigation for long flows, and lack of supporting information.</p>

		<h2>Rethinking the Modal.</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">Bring the issue up with leadership, I was asked to rethink the import modal.</span> Moving back to scratch, I explored more on the purpose of modals, how they’re used across the product, and best practices:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/modal-research.png" alt="Modal Research">
        <p>From this, I developed a list of overarching modal principles that would guide me as I designed a new import modal to house the AWS import flow.</p>

        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<img src="images/lucid/attention.svg" class="principle-icon">

					</div>
				</div>
        <p>Through this exploration, I created a new modal that was built on the current small import modal and the principles.</p>
		<a href="images/lucid/modal-in-product.png" data-lightbox="process-12"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/modal-in-product.png" alt="Modal in Product"></a>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
			<div class="col-sm-6 no-mobile">
				<ul>
					<li>Twice the width of the old import modal.</li>
					<li>Left half for primary interactions, right half for secondary flows or supporting information.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<ul>
				<li>Modal to ensure the canvas is still safe, but large enough to demand full attention.</li>
				<li>Left vertical progress bar that doubles as navigation.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Due to this extension of the old design, I was able to cleanly implement my previous import flow design into it. <span class="highlight">I tested the flow in this new modal and it performed far better.</span></p>
	</div>
	<a href="images/lucid/modal-pages.png" data-lightbox="process-11"><img data-aos="fade-up" class='final-hero' src="images/lucid/modal-pages.png" alt="Modal Pages Laid Out"></a>
	<div class='detailed'>
		<br/>
		<p>Overall, the design of this import flow performed extremely well amongst users and also impacted the product by giving a place to <span class="highlight">offer more informative and cohesive complex experiences within Lucidchart.</span> This modal was added to the design system and extended to other parts of the product.</p>

		<h1 data-aos="fade-up">Challenge #2: The Left Panel.</h1>
        <p>Upon importing their architecture into Lucidchart, users previously would be greeted with the diagram on the canvas, with the default left panel being overlapped by this new left panel to edit the architecture.</p>
        <a href="images/lucid/old-integration-left.png" data-lightbox="process-13"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/old-integration-left.png" alt="Old Left Panel Integration"></a>
        <p>In Lucidchart, the left panel is the primary interaction point where users can drag shapes onto their canvas. If they’re interacting with a complex data-linked shape, like an organization chart, the left panel transforms for manipulating the shape.</p>
		<h2>The Problem.</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">The new AWS architecture import needed its own left panel.</span> This left panel would be the point where users could control their diagram.</p>
  
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<a href="images/lucid/old-left-panel.png" data-lightbox="process-14"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/old-left-panel.png" alt="First Left Panel Integration"></a>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<p>Following the structure of the left panel from other integrations, I attempted to make one that would serve the needs of CloudInsights.</p>
			</div>
        </div>

        <p>As I was building it out, however, I noticed that the given menus became jumbled and messy. With multiple functionalities, <span class="highlight">menus became just drawers where features were stuffed in for convenience.</span> This is what the current information architecture of the left panel looked like.</p>
		<img src="images/lucid/old-ia.png" alt="Old Information Architecture">
		<h2>Exploration.</h2>
		<p>I worked through this information architecture and <span class="highlight">conducted card sorting sessions with users.</span> From this exercise, it became apparent that there was a much better way for sorting the features.</p>

        <p>With features sorted by <span class="highlight">purposes or intents rather than function</span>, it became clearer and offered a cleaner user flow based on their goals. With the expanded set of features that allows for multiple flows and goals, it made sense for features to be sorted by that criteria.</p>
        <div class="video-wrapper">

          </video>
        </div>
        <p>However, this separation could not exist in just menus. <span class="highlight">Detailed interactions and supporting different cognitive states were necessary and required a deeper experience than dropdown menus.</span></p>
        <p>Again, I established design principles for the left panel to ensure that as I redesigned the left panel, I wouldn't be breaking other cases.</p>

		<p>I began exploring and moved towards tabs as it closely matched the principles, resulting in <span class="highlight">the birth of the tabbed left panel.</span></p>
        
        <p>This underwent lots of iterations while I worked with other designers at Lucid and also tested with users.</p>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">

					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>It began with two tabs, but users found the “Design” tab confusing and split in purposes. They also found it hard to accomplish higher level goals, such as refreshing their architecture. However, the tab structure made what was presented much cleaner and easier to find tools.</p>

        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
			<div class="col-sm-6">
            	<p>With three tabs, users found it a little easier to grasp the goal of each tab, but still had difficulty in using the left panel as navigation through pages of their diagram, along with some icon ambiguity.</p>

        <p>The final iteration was one that held up extremely well under testing, where all users were able to accomplish all of their goals. <span class="highlight">Working with other teams across the product, it was also easy to apply it to their use cases.</span></p>
