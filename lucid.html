          <p>For this project, I was responsible for designing the experience around the import of Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud architectures into Lucidchart, ranging from how users import the architecture and how they can interact with the diagram on the canvas.</p>
          <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/two-experiences.png" alt="Two Experiences: Import and On-Canvas">
          <p><span class="highlight">I was the sole designer on a scrum team working within a 2-week sprint cycle. My team consisted of myself, a product manager, five engineers, and a QA specialist.</span></p>
          <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>Cloud Engineers have to make enormously complex diagrams for numerous reasons, whether it’s communicating changes or for documentation purposes.</p>
          <a href="images/lucid/example.png" data-lightbox="overview-1"><img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/example.png" alt="Example AWS Architecture"></a>
          <p>Lucidchart had just a barebones feature for importing architectures, but it was rarely used because it was hard to import the data correctly and even harder to manipulate it the way engineering wanted. <span class="highlight">Often times, engineers would end up deleting the imported architecture and remake it from scratch. Making a cloud architecture diagram was a pain and a nuisance no one looked forward to doing.</span></p>
          <a href="images/lucid/old-integration.png" data-lightbox="overview-2"><img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/old-integration.png" alt="The Old AWS Integration"></a>
          <p><span class="highlight">We wanted to reshape the industry and change this perception entirely:</span></p>
          <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/paradigm-shift.png" alt="The Paradigm Shift">
          <p>On starting this project, I took stock of what was already done and strategized my plan for designing this experience.</p>

						<img class="no-shadow" src="images/lucid/process.png" alt="The Design Process">
          </figure>
          <p>This process led to the first version of Lucidchart’s CloudInsights, which now has seven teams dedicated to its success. It also led to two new components in Lucid’s design system, <span class="highlight">components primarily focused for complex data-diagrams and scaled into other integrations</span> such as Salesforce or bambooHR integrations.</p>

				<p>I first wanted to understand the problems with our primary users, hoping to understand the higher-level problems and motivations, while identifying key pain points in a DevOps personas job. Through this stage I conducted three types of research:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" class="no-shadow final-hero" src="images/lucid/research.png" alt="Initial Research Methods">
        <p>I collated all this information in a document and <span class="highlight">conducted affinity diagramming to identify key pain points, user motivations, goals, frustrations, responsibilities, and current processes.</span> From this I could develop personas and also locate problem points in a cloud architect’s job:</p>
        
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Multiple Programs for Management</strong></p>

				<div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">				
						<p>Hitting the ground, I had no idea how an AWS architecture worked. I was pretty lost in this extremely complicated world. <span class="highlight">So here's a short crash course as how I understood it.</span></p>

        <p>To design for architecture diagrams, I had to first understand them. While conducting research, I also independently learned about AWS architectures and how they were structured.</p>

						<p>In short, clouds provide multiple services ranging from computing servers, deployment services, traffic distribution, and more. An entire system, from the moment a user enters a website and finally completes their goal, can exist on the cloud.</p>
					</div>
        </div>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>Cloud architectures are structured in a certain way, with some elements only allowed to live in some objects. For example, an EC2 must exist in a subnet, which exists in an availability zone, which is in a VPC, which is in a region. However, there are hundreds of different types of instances and each has their own special rules. <span class="highlight">Don’t worry, I hate it too.</span></p>

        <h2>DEVOPS PERSONAS?</h2>
        <p>Anyways, back to synthesizing research I generated three personas, two who were primary users and one who was secondary. These personas were posted up at every table in the scrum team to ensure we were focused on our user.</p>

					</div>
        </div>

        <h2>SPECIFYING THE FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Based on the research, I worked with my PM and came up with a number of high-level features or capabilities. To further understand these features, I went through this flow in treating out how these features would behave and act:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/feature-flow.png" alt="How Features Were Decided">
        <p>Throughout this, regarding the features, I wanted to discover:</p>
        <ul>
					<li>What should it accomplish?</li>
					<li>When and why does the user use it?</li>
					<li>How should it treat the user?</li>
					<li>How does it scale across the product?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To structure the design into phases and following other complex imports in the product, I split the design into two phases: the import flow and the on-canvas experience.</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/two-experiences.png" alt="Two Experiences: Import and On-Canvas">

        <p>Despite splitting them up, the primary goal was the same: <span class="highlight">to offer the most powerful, cohesive experience where users can consistently return to manage and communicate their architecture.</span></p>
        <p>From this point on, I worked on the import flow and the on-canvas experience in parallel. However, to keep things clear, I’ll discuss it in order of how it appears to the user: import flow then on-canvas experience.</p>

        <h2>THE IMPORT FLOW</h2>
        <p>The current import flow allowed for users to import their account through three different methods, choose a few options, and get it on the canvas.</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/old-flow.png" alt="Old Import Modal Flow">
        <p>However, in order to offer a more robust experience, the new import flow would have to manage this:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/new-flow.png" alt="New Import Modal Flow">

        <p>The reason for this far more complex flow was due to user needs and also experience design decisions:</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Multiple Accounts</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Being able to import multiple accounts is essential, as many users often have a single cloud spanning across multiple AWS accounts, but need to be able to see everything on one screen.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Filtering Data</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Despite the security of our product, a small portion of our users would need to keep some data regarding their architecture removed from import. We wanted to meet the needs of these users and provide that ability, instead of forcing them to manually diagram their architecture due to requirements.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Page Layout</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">We found that if users weren’t happy with how things were automatically laid out, they often found it easier to restart from scratch rather than move everything around. By enabling more flexibility in the final layout, we could ensure a better user experience all-around.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Shapes</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">AWS comes out with new shapes to represent their instances rather frequently. Unfortunately, not all users like to represent their diagrams with newer shapes, some preferring the older skeuomorphic designs.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

        <p>With the current component, this new flow had to exist in the current import modal. The problem is...</p>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<a href="images/lucid/old-import-flow.png" data-lightbox="process-6"><img src="images/lucid/old-import-flow.png" alt="Old Import Modal"></a>

						<p>...it's tiny.</p>

        </div>

        <p>I created multiple versions in the import modal and concept tested them with both users, my scrum team, and the UX team. Each one ran into problems.</p>

					</div>
        </div>

        <p>Through this exploration, I noticed a number of issues with the modal itself, primarily in the small size not providing an immersive experience, no progress trackers, poor navigation for long flows, and lack of supporting information.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">I had to rethink the import modal.</span> Moving back to scratch, I explored more on the purpose of modals, how they’re used across the product, and best practices:</p>
        <img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/modal-research.png" alt="Modal Research">
        <p>From this, I developed a list of overarching modal principles that would guide me as I designed a new import modal to house the AWS import flow.</p>

        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">

					</div>
				</div>
        <p>Through this exploration, I created a new modal that was built on the current small import modal and the principles.</p>
		<a href="images/lucid/new-modal-1.png" data-lightbox="process-10"><img data-aos="fade-up" src="images/lucid/new-modal-1.png" alt="New Modal Page 1"></a>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
			<div class="col-sm-6 no-mobile">
				<ul>
					<li>Twice the width of the old import modal</li>
					<li>Left half for primary interactions, second half for secondary flows or supporting information</li>

			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<ul>
				<li>Modal to ensure the canvas is still safe, but large enough to demand full attention</li>
				<li>Left vertical progress bar that doubles as navigation</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Due to this extension of the old design, I was able to cleanly implement my previous import flow design into it. The performance in usability tests was far better.</p>
	</div>
	<a href="images/lucid/modal-pages.png" data-lightbox="process-11"><img data-aos="fade-up" class='final-hero' src="images/lucid/modal-pages.png" alt="Modal Pages Laid Out"></a>
	<div class='detailed'>
		<br/>
		<p>Overall, the design of this import flow performed extremely well amongst users and also impacted the product by giving a place to <span class="highlight">offer more informative and cohesive complex experiences within Lucidchart.</span> This modal was added to the design system and extended to other parts of the product.</p>

        <h2>THE LEFT PANEL</h2>
        <p>Upon importing their architecture into Lucidchart, users previously would be greeted with the diagram on the canvas, with this left panel overlapping the default left panel to edit the architecture.</p>
        <a href="images/lucid/old-integration.png" data-lightbox="process-13"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/old-integration.png" alt="Old Left Panel Integration"></a>
        <p>In Lucidchart, the left panel is the primary interaction point where users can drag shapes onto their canvas. If they’re interacting with a complex data-linked shape, like an organization chart, the left panel transforms into a panel for manipulating the shape.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">The new AWS architecture import needed its own left panel.</span> This left panel would be the point where users could control their diagram.</p>
        
        <p>I first began by listing all the requested features highly rated by users and listing them all down:</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Line Control</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Drawing lines between instances is one of the most important parts for communicating architecture diagrams.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Spacing</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Tweaking spacing between instances as a whole make reduce lots of tedious movement.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Sorting and Grouping</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">How instances are sorted and grouped together is extremely important in identifying what’s most relevant.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Labels</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Removing labels from unnecessary object would reduce word clutter in presentations.</p>
						</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Overall Layout</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Quickly switching the overall layout would simplify presentations to both directors and engineers immensely.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Data Refresh</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Being able to refresh would make it useful to not need to constantly import a new architecture each time it was updated.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>At this point, I realized I had lost sight of the major goal of restructuring the approach of users to cloud diagrams entirely. Though this data was valuable in understanding goals, it came from the perception of users that this would just augment their current flow. <span class="highlight">We wanted to re-engineer their approach entirely.</span></p>
        <p>I lead this conversation by focusing on the entire current user journey, pain points with Lucidchart’s current solution, and looked deeper at other applications that our users used. I worked with my PM and the team tech lead to design a solution where users could use Lucidchart for all their needs: <span class="highlight">an end-to-end flow where users could build, monitor, and present all from Lucidchart.</span></p>
        <p>Working with the PM and tech lead for this part was particularly helpful, as I could design while considering business perspectives, how things extend to other parts of the product, and the feasibility of features.</p>
        <img src="images/lucid/before.png" alt="The Before Flow">
        <img src="images/lucid/after.png" alt="The After Flow">

        <p>To make this possible, we included a number of features that would serve to support this goal.</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Edit Data</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Users could edit the data on instances and save it, enabling them to plan a new version of their architecture.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Users can specify rules on what instances they want to highlight, so they can easily identify problem areas.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Saving Views</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Users can create and save layouts so they can quickly switch views from one that is aimed towards directors, one for engineers, or more.</p>
						</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Export Terraform</strong></p>
							<p class="left-line">Users can export their created layout to upload onto their AWS server.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
        </div>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<a href="images/lucid/old-left-panel.png" data-lightbox="process-14"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/old-left-panel.png" alt="First Left Panel Integration"></a>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>Following the structure of the left panel from other integrations, I quickly created a left panel that housed the features we needed.</p>
					</div>
        </div>

        <p>I created videos and interactive mocks with this left panel, which my PM took on sales tests to see whether this cohesive experience appealed to users. <span class="highlight">The results were heavily positive.</span></p>
        <p>As I was building out the left panel, however, I noticed that the given menus became jumbled and messy. With multiple functionalities, <span class="highlight">menus became just drawers where features were stuffed in for convenience.</span></p>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img src="images/lucid/old-ia.png" alt="Old Information Architecture">
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>A massive toolset that becomes confusing. On user testing, people found it extremely difficult to find the right tool to accomplish their goal.</p>
					</div>
        </div>
        <p>I worked through this information architecture and <span class="highlight">conducted card sorting sessions with users.</span> From this exercise, it became apparent that there was a much better way for sorting the features.</p>

        <p>Here, for our design, there was a major discovery. <span class="highlight">With features sorted by purposes, it became much clearer and offered a cleaner user flow based on their goals.</span> Although it seems obvious in hindsight, our expanded feature that allows for multiple flows and goals made more sense to be separated by just that.</p>
        <div class="video-wrapper">
          <video autoplay muted playsinline loop>
            <source src="images/lucid/transform-ia.webm" type="video/webm" />

            Your browser does not support the video tag.
          </video>
        </div>
        <p>However, this separation could not exist in just menus. <span class="highlight">Detailed interactions and supporting different cognitive states were necessary and required a deeper experience than dropdown menus.</span></p>
        <p>Again, I established design principles for the left panel to ensure as I redesigned the left panel, I wasn’t breaking other cases.</p>
        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">

        </div>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>I worked with other UX designers on various teams, resulting in <span class="highlight">the birth of the tabbed left panel.</span></p>

            <a href="images/lucid/new-panel-1.png" data-lightbox="process-15"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/new-panel-1.png" alt="Left Panel Explore"></a>
					</div>
        </div>
        
        <p>This underwent lots of iterations while I worked with other designers at Lucid and also tested with users.</p>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<a href="images/lucid/left-panel-iteration1.png" data-lightbox="process-16"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/left-panel-iteration1.png" alt="Left Panel Iteration 1"></a>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>It began with two tabs, but users found the “Design” tab confusing and split in purposes. They also found it hard to accomplish higher level goals, such as refreshing their architecture.</p>
					</div>
        </div>
        <div class="split-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>With three tabs, users found it a little easier to grasp the goal of each tab, but still had difficulty in refreshing their architecture as well as navigating through pages of their diagram.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
            <a href="images/lucid/left-panel-iteration2.png" data-lightbox="process-17"><img class="shadow" src="images/lucid/left-panel-iteration2.png" alt="Left Panel Iteration 2"></a>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<p>Here, the refresh was a banner that offered more information. It also was able to switch through high-level containers, such as accounts, through the top title bar. This was particularly helpful for teams working with other parts of the product.</p>
					</div>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, I created a final iteration that held up extremely well under testing, where all users were able to accomplish all of their goals.</p>

        <div class="indented-block" data-aos="fade-up">
					<div class="flex-inline">

          <div class="flex-inline">
						<div>
							<p><strong>Perspectives</strong></p>

						</div>
					</div>
        </div>
        <p>The end result was a more powerful “task-oriented” panel that presents information through user discovery and allows for “Perspectives”. This left panel was added to the design system and extended to other parts of the product.</p>
        <a href="images/lucid/aws-final.png" data-lightbox="process-19"><img src="images/lucid/aws-final.png" alt="AWS Final Integration"></a>
        <p>A deeper exploration of the final design of the left panel can be found in the final design tab.</p>

        <h2>BRINGING IT ALL BACK</h2>
        <p><span class="highlight">With the design of the new import modal and left panel, I was able to work with my team to design the AWS import experience, as well as add value to the rest of the company.</span></p> 
        <p>I learned a lot during my time here in how to work in a fast-paced environment, and take initiative and ownership in design. I also learned to think more holistically regarding the company on how things can extend or remain consistent with the rest of the product.</p>
        <p>CloudInsights has since then been released on Lucidchart, and has expanded to include multiple teams to support it.</p>

						<h4>Final Note</h4>
						<p class="final-note">My experience in designing for Lucidchart was extremely fun and extremely demanding. While working on this product, I became aware of the importance of not designing in a bubble, but including other parts of the company as well, even if their features seem unrelated at first.</p>
            <p class="final-note">One of the most important lessons I learned was that taking the initiative and involving users and others earlier usually results in better results, something I will be sure to do in the future.</p>
            <p class="final-note"><span class="highlight">This design is now available to use on Lucidchart.</span></p>
