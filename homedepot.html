					<h2 id="contributions">MY CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
					<p>I primarily acted as the design strategist for this project. I roadmapped our projected plan for this project, and led sessions to synthesis findings, pull design implications, and create high-level designs, such as information architectures.</p>
					<p>In addition, I also created high-fidelity mockups and made prototypes for testing. Finally, I also acted as a project manager, setting roadmaps, goals, and gathering resources and participants for interviews or testing.</p>    
				<hr class="featurette-divider">
				<h2 id="intro">intro</h2>
              <p>This project’s goal was to aid our primary users – Home Depot associates – by creating a system that is <span class="highlight">easy for first-time users to learn and pick up, while also expediting the workflow of experienced users.</span></p>
							<p>When approaching this problem, I first wanted to strategize a plan. Though it might change later on in the project, it would be a good way to get everyone on-board and focused.</p>
							<p>Based on the problem and user space, my outlined process for this project would go through several stages:</p>

					<h1 id="exploration">EXPLORATION</h1>
	            	<p class="subtitle">“Our investigation of the user’s context, pain points, and needs”</p>
	        	</div>
	        	<hr class="featurette-divider">
	            <h2 id="clientinterview">CLIENT INTERVIEW</h2>
	        	<p>At the beginning of our project, my team and I interviewed our clients, Home Depot UX designers. We sat with them and asked them a number of prepared questions <span class="highlight">so that we could better understand the problem space and how the issue first came about to be.</span> Though they weren't the primary users, it would be useful to see their reasons for initializing a redesign.</p>
				<p>From the interview I mainly gained information regarding how the problem of the FirstPhone came to be, how the problem hinders Home Depot associate’s work, and how Home Depot associates learn how to use the FirstPhone. Their main problem became clear:</p>
				<div class="call-out">
					<h4><strong>Too many apps reduce efficiency</strong></h4>
				</div>
				<p>The FirstPhone had up to nearly forty apps to scroll through, each with a specific purpose. However, many of these apps would never be touched by most employees.</p>
				<h2 id="secondary_research">BACKGROUND RESEARCH</h2>
	        	<p>With a base understanding, we began <span class="highlight">background research to better understand the context of the FirstPhone</span> at a fast and low-cost method. One interesting resource I found was a Home Depot subreddit that many employees frequented. This was a useful resource where we could later communicate with Home Depot associates, and see many of the common complaints they had.</p>

				<p>We also obtained a list of current apps on the FirstPhone, which helped clarify the main problem of having too many apps on the device. I wrote down the name and function of each app, as well as who uses it on a sticky note. We sorted these notes as a group into similar categories so that we could easily uncover relations and overlapping functionalities.</p>

				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/appsOnPhone.jpg" alt="List of Apps Currently on Phone">
				  <figcaption>The list of apps currently on the FirstPhone, along with their functionality.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Here we found an interesting fact: <span class="highlight">many apps accomplished the same goals, but just in different ways.</span> Boiled down, the functionality of the FirstPhone could be reduced down from 40 to around 10 purposes.</p>
				<h2 id="interviews">INTERVIEWS</h2>
	        	<p>After getting a decent background knowledge of the issue, I wanted to explore the problem from our main user’s point of view. <span class="highlight">Interviews allowed us to confirm existing information</span> from the industry contact and secondary research, and to catapult us into thinking in context of the store employee’s day-to-day work life.</p>

				<p><span class="highlight">Talking to Home Depot field employees gave me first-hand insight into their day-to-day operations and how they interacted with the FirstPhone,</span> which were not disclosed in print or online literature and even unbeknownst to UX designers on the Home Depot corporate side. Many of these operations and practices involved the FirstPhone but often turned out to deviate from intended usage and were situated in particular locations or times. These interviews also revealed other important contexts, such as the limited amount of FirstPhones in each department.</p>

				<p>We also interviewed more <span class="highlight">UX designers on the corporate-side to understand limitations in design</span> from either corporate structure or anything else we were unaware of.</p>

				<h2 id="fieldobservations">FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY</h2>
	        	<p>Afterwards, we wanted to see how our primary user interacted with the FirstPhone, and how the context they were in affected their usage of the device. This would help us build our personas and storyboard, and help us understand the processes and pain points our users went through. This would be accomplished through <span class="highlight">ethnographic field observations, with follow-up contextual inquiries if we needed a deeper understanding on anything we saw.</span></p>

				<p>Based on all the information gained thus far, <span class="highlight">we were able to pinpoint major pain points and frustrations</span> with the current FirstPhone, both on the field and corporate side.</p>

				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/in-store.jpg" alt="In-store">
				  <figcaption>The environmental context Home Depot Associates work in.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2 id="surveys">SURVEYS</h2>
	        	<p>Having completed our background research and spoken with a few in-store associates, we needed to collect more information on how users perceived the FirstPhone. <span class="highlight">The best way to reach a large audience was through an online survey,</span> and luckily we had access to over 200 Home Depot employees through an online reddit page.</p>

				<p>Surveys would allow us to reach a larger quantity of users than an in-store visit, and therefore could provide us with a larger variety of feedback, pushing us closer to a more accurate representation of the population. Apart from being the quickest data collection method we used, it also allowed us to turn subjective data, such as individual thoughts and feelings about the FirstPhone, into a quantitative format. <span class="highlight">This provided us with metrics that allowed us to reaffirm our design decisions, and provided us with definitive backing as part of our evidence-based design process.</span></p>

				<p>However, it’s important to note that even though our respondents were actual Home Depot employees, because the survey was administered through reddit only a subset of all Home Depot employees could answer our survey – those who are actively on reddit. This meant generally more technology savvy/oriented individuals and was not 100% representative of the target population.</p>

				<h2 id="personas">PERSONAS &amp; SCENARIOS</h2>
	        	<p>From our research findings <span class="highlight">we derived three personas and their respective working scenarios.</span> This allowed us to understand and remember each one of our users, while also using scenarios to note how they completed their goals at Home Depot and what they valued from systems helping them. Our design would need to improve their working process from the scenario, without drastically changing it and forcing people to relearn a new complex system.</p>

				<h2 id="affinitydiagramming">AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING</h2>
				<p>To analyze all the information we gathered thus far, we each wrote down snippets of data onto sticky notes. We then conducted an <span class="highlight">affinity diagramming session where we organized data points into similar categories,</span> and then wrote category titles for each group. This was extremely useful for us for aligning all our thoughts and getting a comprehensive view of our research into a single view.</p>

				  <figcaption>Combining our research and sorting it on categories.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>For each category, we each independently wrote possible design implications on separate sticky notes and attached them to the relevant categories. We then reconvened and went through each possible design implication, going through the feasibility and the justifications for each point. Based on our personas, we ensured that each design implication was positive for each of our personas.</p>
				<p>Some major design implications we found related to privilege control, context-aware adaptation, being able to handle errors, and accessibility needs due to poor in-store lighting and small screens.</p>

				<h2 id="paperprototype">PAPER PROTOTYPE</h2>
				<p>Using all our information gathered, we sketched various concepts that would meet our previously established design requirements. <span class="highlight">Each of these concepts met all of our design requirements, but differed in how the associate conducted their workflow.</span> We narrowed it down to three designs, which we made low-fidelity wireframes of. We brought these into focus group meetings with Home Depot associates for testing.</p>

				<p><span class="highlight">Our three concepts were a task-based design, a process-based design, and an AR-based design.</span></p>
				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/taskbased.jpg" alt="Task-Based Concept">
				  <figcaption>Our task-based concept that focused on a "task-first" mindset.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>The task-based design focused on the user flow of users starting from a task, and seeing associated apps that they could use to complete the task. This concept’s goal was to change the thinking from “which app do I use to fix this problem” to a simple “which task do I complete”.</p>

				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/processbased.jpg" alt="Process-Based Concept">
				  <figcaption>Our process-based concept that focused on process flexibility and shortcuts.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>The process-based design was inspired by the fact that many employees had their own process of doing things. It removed the concept of apps and simply had “functions”, such as scan an item. Users could chain functions together to create their own processes.</p>

				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/arbased.jpg" alt="AR-Based Concept">
				  <figcaption>Our AR-based concept that focused on simplicity and context-awareness.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>The AR-based design came from a more “scan-to-start” idea, where the user would start with the item first, instead of thinking how to find an app to pair with an item. Users would simply point their camera at a product, and a list of relevant tasks to be done with the item would appear. This concept emphasized simplicity and context-aware actions.</p>
				<p>From our testing, associates liked the AR-based design the most, with some parts of the task-based design. <span class="highlight">We decided to combine winning ideas from each concept into our final design.</span></p>

				<h2 id="infoarchitecture">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h2>
				<p>To develop our design, we first started with the <span class="highlight">information architecture.</span> This was important to show the overall structure of our system, ensured that it was understandable to users, and that it included all our necessary functions. We whiteboarded this stage with varous iterations until we had a design we were all confident in.</p>

				<figure>
				  <img src="images/homedepot/information-architecture.jpg" alt="Information Architecture">
				  <figcaption>The final (messy) whiteboard of our Information Architecture.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2 id="highfidelity">HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPING</h2>
				<p>Based on our information architecture, we created a <span class="highlight">high-fidelity prototype that closely reflected a refined app for further testing.</span> This app was created with <span class="highlight">Sketch and InVision.</span> The nature of this concept was similar to how the FirstPhone works currently, a default UI that runs on top of the Android operating system on the phone. However, our concept moves away from the idea of “apps” and relies on the use of augmented reality (AR) to help complete tasks. We presented this concept to Home Depot associates during our second round of testing as an interactive prototype, allowing them to get a better feel of what the finished product would look like.</p>

				<p>After our testing was complete, we had a debriefing session where we wrote down the main takeaways on a white board and walked through all the points as a group, understanding them in a broader sense, then devising ways for our design to address one or more of these points.</p>

				<figure>
				  <a href="images/homedepot/high-fidelity-ia.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/homedepot/high-fidelity-ia.jpg" alt="High-Fidelity UX Prototype IA"></a>
				  <figcaption>A breakdown of the screens in our interactive prototype.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2 id="finalinteractiveprototype">FINAL PROTOTYPE</h2>
				<p><span class="highlight">The final iteration of our prototype encompasses everything we learned from our user testing with Home Depot store associates, supervisors, and assistant store managers.</span></p>

				<p>Our design addresses the main problem by retooling how associates would approach a problem. Currently, associates would have to identify an issue, choose the correct app from memory recall, and follow the steps within apps that are inconsistent and unique from others. Through this, work experience becomes the key to a successful associates, after braving a field of trials and errors. Our design instead approaches issues from an item-based standpoint. Associates would first scan a product and then identify a task they want to accomplish through the design. This would make it easier for day-one associates to learn the process, and experience associates to accomplish tasks faster.</p>

				<p>We built a final interactive prototype with <span class="highlight">Sketch and InVision</span> and brought it to Home Depot UX designers and store associates for a final round of validation testing.</p>

				<p><span class="highlight">With the Home Depot designers, our design fared extremely well in how it restructured the employee workflow.</span> They also liked the aesthetic design and consistency. However, parts of our design still needed to be improved, such as including providing more error prevention and designing a clearer visibility of system status. These factors were extremely important for us to consider, with the large portion of the user group would not be intuitively familiar with new technology.</p>

				<p><span class="highlight">With the Home Depot store associates, we took extra note of metrics such as time to complete task and amount of errors made.</span> Users accomplished tasks much faster with our design, as opposed to the traditional FirstPhone. Day-one employees also found it much more intuitive to use. Unfortunately, some users did have some confusion regarding the AR concept and were lost in the pages. Nonetheless, the response was overwhelmingly in favor of our new redesign.</p>
